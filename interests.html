            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                I consider myself very lucky in that I have all sorts of things that I am interested in.
                However, for the sake of brevity I will only discuss a few topics that I have an interest in.
                You will notice below that I did not include photography despite having an entire page on this site
                dedicated to it. Well actually that is the very reason I did not include it here. I talk about my
                photography at length in the photogallery so I thought I'd focus on some other things here. They are in
                no particular order:

                    <h2 id="CompSci">Computer Science</h2>

                    <p>As mentioned in the Welcome Page, I am currently studying Computer Science at UCC.
                        Specifically, I am studying the CK401 course, which offers a Bachelor of Science with
                        Honours certification. I initially chose UCC because of my familiarity with Cork,
                        however I soon learned of the school's high reputation, especially when it comes to
                        CS. I am enjoying my studies thus far.</p>
                    <h3 id="cprog">C Programming</h3>
                    <p>So far the topic that interests me most is the lower-level, hardware side of Computer Science.
                        For
                        this reason, in addition to my regular studies in University, I am also learning the C
                        programming language since it is still the de facto standard for the kind of systems programming
                        that I am interested in. I am studying the language from the book "C Programming, A Modern
                        Approach Second Edition" by K. N. King. The book is definitely a tome at around 800 pages,
                        however it is
                        very approachable and I am already around 1/10th of the way through it after only a couple of
                        study sessions with it. I think that speaks more to the high standard of pedagogy in the book
                        rather than any skill I posess. I have had to temporarily postpone my reading of it though,
                        because of
                        my end of semester exams.</p>

                    <h3 id="bread">Breadboard Computer</h3>
                    <p class="blink">This is less of a specific interest but rather a kind of project I see around on the internet
                        that seems like a very good learning opportunity for me. That would be to build what is known as
                        a "breadboard computer". Simply put, it is a computer that is bult from scratch using
                        commercially available electronic components on an electronics breadboard. These homemade
                        computers are usually made with
                        either an 8-bit or 16-bit architecture. What serves as a good learning resource and what really
                        put me on to this project is the excellent ongoing YouTube series by a fellow named Ben Eater in
                        which he creates a 65c02 microprocessor based breadboard computer. Click on the image to the

                    <h3 id="x2">X220</h3>
                    <p>I have a strong interest in ThinkPad laptops. They are my favourite make of laptops, in fact. I
                        like the old ones in particular, because the modern ones seem to falling into some of the
                        pitfalls of modern laptop design. The older models are free from these
                        faults though, and they are tough as nails. Thanks to the easy upgradability of older ThinkPads,
                        I can continue to use my nearly 13 year old laptop well into the future.</p>

                    <p>To the right is a picture of the very laptop I used to create 95% of this website. This X220 was
                        the
                        first
                        ThinkPad I bought in the summer of 2022, I like it because it has a nice balance of the
                        old-fashioned
                        practicality and aesthetics while also having enough computing power to be perfectly viable for
                        most
                        modern computation tasks. The X220 was intoruced in 2011</p>

                <section>
                    <h3 id="t6">T60</h3>
                    <p>I have to confess, one of my favourite types of computer, not just among ThinkPads but in
                        general, are the old 4:3 ThinkPads. I am lucky enough to own a T60 in superb condition, which I
                        bought from a business so the good condition of the laptop is even more notable. The T60 was
                        first introduced in 2006. I swapped the motherboard in mine with that of a T61 which is almost
                        identical excpet that it can accept slightly newer processors.</p>
                    <p class="blink">Unfortunately, it is getting more and more difficult to use the T60 as hardware requirements for
                        popular software and websites is only increasing and even with the best possible hardware, one
                        can expect lag and slowdown, especially for graphical applications. There is, however, a
                        Computer Engineer from Singapore who is currently developing a
                        <a href="https://www.xyte.ch/t700-crowdfunding/" target="_blank">drop in replacment
                            motherboard</a>
                        for these
                        old laptops which utilizes the latest Intel processors and accomodates current common RAM
                        configurations. It is a small project and if it reaches completion these new motherboards won't
                        be made in large quantities, but it at least gives these laptops a further lease on life.</p>

                    <h2 id="Hist">History</h2>
                    <p>History is a topic that I have always loved, even before computers. Whenever I would visit my
                        Grandparent's house, my Grandfather would always have some kind of a history documentary on. If
                        I did not choose to study Computer Science, I probably would have studied either History or
                        Archaeology. For example, I did better in History than in Mathematics on my Leaving
                        Certificate, which is probably not the result I'd want as a Computer Scientist.</p>

                    <h3>My Leaving Certificate Project</h3>
                    <p class="blink">In LC History, students are required to produce a small body of work on a historical topic which
                        is of interest to them. They are given a wide degree of latitude as to what they would like to
                        do their project on. In my case, I elected to do my project on the first flight from Britain to
                        Ireland as carried out by Denys Corbett Wilson in 1912. I carried out this body of work because
                        aviation and it's history is another interest of mine, and as well it is a piece of local (to
                        me) history that I felt was not properly appreciated. Also, supposedly my
                        Great-Great-Grandfather was in the photograph to the left, taken after the event took
                        place (nobody was injured in the crash-landing, although Wilson later perished three years later
                        in the First World War.)</p>
