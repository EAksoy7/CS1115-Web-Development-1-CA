            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Good day to you, my name is Emin. Welcome to my personal page, here you
                will find some information about myself, along with some information about my interests
                and a gallery of some of my amateur photography.</p>

            <p>
                In this welcome page, along with some information about me, you can also find information
                about my <a href="#education">education</a>, and my <a href="#work">work experience</a>
            </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>My name is Emin Aksoy, at the time of writing I am 19 years old and am
                currently a first year undergraduate student studying Computer Science at University College
                Cork. My interests broadly include computing, photography and history.</p>

            <p class="blink">I was born in Cork in 2004, however I have lived most of my life in Enniscorthy,
                Co. Wexford. I first attended St. Aidan's Parish School, I then attended what was then
                known as Enniscorthy Vocational College, though the school's name has since changed to
                Enniscorthy Community College. Once I finished there, I did a QQI Level 5 course in
                Computer Science so that I could attend University College Cork.</p>

                    <h3>Blue Escape Dive Center - 2019</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the summer of 2019, I did volunteer work at Blue Escape Dive Center in Bodrum, Turkey.
                        I did this volunteer work because I was working on getting a SCUBA diving certification
                        at the time and I took advantage of the opportunity to do lots of diving experience by
                        working with the staff there, since the dive center also brought tourists on daily dive
                        trips. I acted as an assistant to the dive leaders, and as a Turkish - English interpreter.

                    <h3>Gadget Technology Enniscorthy - 2022-2023</h3>
                    <p>
                        For the duration of my QQI course, part of the curriculum was that I had to do work
                        experience in an ICT job. I applied to various offices, shops, and even my former
                        secondary school; I could not find work anywhere, except at Gadget Technology in Enniscorthy.
                        I worked there for 1 day per week at first, and then 3 days per week later on in my course.
                        During my tenure there I primarily repaired computers and phones while also working with the
                        general public. At the end of my tenure there, even though it was volunteer work, I still
                        received
                        pay from the proprietor of the business.

                        I am currently working part-time in the family business, Aksoy Jewellers in Ballincollig,
                        Co. Cork. I will likely remain here for the duration of my degree, and also for my
                        Master's Degree, when I eventually do that. Here I help to sell jewellery to the public.
                        We primarily specialise in wedding jewellery, and in 2015 and 2019 we received
                        awards for said wedding jewellery.</p>
